The authors introduce a new type of ODOs and define their Burchnall-Chaundy ideal, which is used to prove Schur's theorem on the isomorphism between centralizers of ODOs and function fields of algebraic curves. The paper also provides an explicit example of a non-planar spectral curve and computes its defining ideal using differential resultants. Keywords include ODOs, spectral curves, differential ideals, differential resultant, and factorization.\""
